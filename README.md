## Land Use Project

For my project, I will analyze proposed land use classification in Atlanta as identified during community planning events.

## R Packages
To analyze the data you will need to install some `R` packages. The required packages can be installed using the command `make install`. The user will be prompted to select a CRAN mirror if packages need to be installed.


## Execute the Analysis

The project files should be run from the Analysis folder. To execute the analysis, from the command line you can run `make report.html` to compile the final project report. This will create a file called `report.html` output in the Rcode folder that contains the resulting frequency table and histogram.

## Additional Help

For additional details and help on rules for making figures and cleaning data, run `make help` from the command line.
